# Game Illumina
This project includes two Java games: a console-based Blackjack game where a single player competes against the dealer following standard rules, and a JavaFX-based Flash Card Game that tests users with random arithmetic questions, tracking scores and featuring a user-friendly interface with a timed challenge.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Java JDK 19 or later.
- JavaFX SDK
- Intellij installed
- Clone the repository to your local machine. I will suggest using HTTP.
- Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
- Import the project onto IntelliJ

## Running Blackjack

To run Blackjack, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to Blackjack.java (src/main/java/org.example/Blackjack), and there will be a "RUN" logo beside the class.
2. Click on it

## How to Play Blackjack

Once the game starts, you will be prompted to hit or stay for each round. The aim is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. Face cards count as 10, and aces can be either 1 or 11.

- To **Hit**, type `H` and press Enter.
- To **Stay**, type `S` and press Enter.

The game continues until you decide to quit after each round.


## Running FlashCard

To run flashcard, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to FlashCardGameApp.java (src/main/java/com.game.flashcard). There will be a "RUN" logo beside the class
2. Click on it

## How to Play Flashcard

When the game begins, a 1-minute timer starts, challenging you to answer as many multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction questions as possible. Once the time expires, your total score will be displayed.
